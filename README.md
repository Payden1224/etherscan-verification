EtherScan Verification Tool

This tool is designed to simplify the process of verifying your smart contract on EtherScan. It automates the steps required to generate the verification code and upload it to EtherScan.

Requirements

To use this tool, you must have the following installed:

Node.js (version 10 or higher)
Truffle (version 5 or higher)
An EtherScan API key (you can get one here)
Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Usage

Compile your smart contract using Truffle. For example: truffle compile.
Deploy your smart contract using Truffle. For example: truffle migrate.
Run the verification tool with the following command:
php
Copy code
node index.js <contract-name> <contract-address> <compiler-version> <optimization>
<contract-name>: The name of your contract as defined in your Solidity file.
<contract-address>: The address of your deployed contract.
<compiler-version>: The version of the Solidity compiler used to compile your contract (e.g. "v0.5.0").
<optimization>: The level of optimization used when compiling your contract (e.g. "200").
The tool will generate the verification code and upload it to EtherScan. You can check the status of the verification on EtherScan by visiting the contract page and clicking on the "Contract Source" tab.
